# Currently, I am interested in following Topics:
I am deeply interested in **Vision-AI**, **Deep Learning**, and **Explainable AI (XAI)**, focusing not only on **efficient model design and optimization** but also on **developing practical applications** using existing AI technologies.  
In particular, I enjoy exploring how **vision-based and explainable techniques**, such as **CAM-based visualization**, can be applied to **healthcare domains** — including **patient monitoring**, **fall detection**, and **medical image analysis** — to improve both **system transparency** and **real-world reliability**.
